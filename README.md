## 1. Overview

Senti is an automated trading platform that helps users take advantage of the market through accurate and real-time indicators. It leverages the Supra oracle to fetch up-to-date price feeds from major cryptocurrencies and operates on the BNB Smart Chain Testnet. User trading activity is then aggregated to gauge market sentiment and further improve the accuracy of the signals.

## 2. Target audience

Senti is designed for crypto-native users who want to accelerate their trading activity by delegating part of their funds to an automated algorithm. This helps them eliminate impulsive behavior and trade only when selected indicators signal the right time to enter the market.

It also serves as a tool for information aggregation, providing an accurate picture of market sentiment by analyzing users' trading activity on the platform.
